Last night in your hotel room
I held you as the sun came up
Staring into your???
In your arms, you set me free

Tomorrow you'll be gone
I'd wake up and have no one
No one here to keep me sane, to keep me safe
Forever feels too long
To stay here on my own
I can't go on like this
Because I'm awake now

Waking up without you
Nothing has ever felt this cruel
Don't take my memories back,
Of you because they're all I have

Tomorrow you'll be gone
I'd wake up and have no one
No one here to keep me sane, to keep me safe
Forever feels too long
To stay here on my own
I can't go on like this
Because I'm awake now

Tomorrow you'll be gone
I'd wake up and have no one
No one to understand, understand
Forever feels too long
To stay here on my own
I can't go on like this, on like this, on like this
Because I'm awake now
