In a bed that I had made
Sleeping here to keep me dreaming
My denial starts to fade
To the sound of someone screaming
In the shadow of my waking
I'll be facing the truth

...
In the dark I awake
In a sweat I start to shake
Awake now
Freezing heart beats again
Knowing I am not afraid
I'm awake now

I didn't think, I didn't try
Cos all I wanted was some peace & quite
But cross my heart & hope to die
An angel came & dragged me up into the light
If the silence turns to violence
Won't be closing my eyes... No

...
In the dark I awake
In a sweat I start to shake
Awake now
Freezing heart beats again
Knowing I am not afraid
I'm awake now

Am I awake or am I still dreaming now?

...
In the dark I awake
In a sweat I start to shake
Awake now
Freezing heart beats again
Knowing I am not afraid
I'm awake now
Awake now
Awake now
Awake now

I'm awake now
Awake now
Awake now
Awake now
Awake now
